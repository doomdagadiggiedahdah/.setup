# espanso match file

# For a complete introduction, visit the official docs at: https://espanso.org/docs/

# You can use this file to define the base matches (aka snippets)
# that will be available in every application when using espanso.

# Matches are substitution rules: when you type the "trigger" string
# it gets replaced by the "replace" string.

matches:
  # NOTE: espanso uses YAML to define matches, so pay attention to the indentation!
  # But matches can also be dynamic:

  # Print the current date
  - trigger: ":d "
    replace: "({{mydate}}) "
    vars:
      - name: mydate
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y.%m.%d"

  - trigger: ":dt"
    replace: "({{datetime}}) "
    vars:
      - name: datetime
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%Y.%m.%d__%H.%M.%S"

  - trigger: ":t "
    replace: "({{time}}) "
    vars:
      - name: time
        type: date
        params:
          format: "%H:%M:%S"
