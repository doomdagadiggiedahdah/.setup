# thine setup
- fun story; once I accidentally ran a command that accidentally reset my hotkeys (which makes me sad) and at that point only knew how to set them through the gui (read: slowly, painfully).
- The command did show me how to set hotkeys via the cli, and so a solution was set.
- this is the result of realizing again that scripts are your friend, and that I like having some pieces of consistency in my life. Hotkeys.

## Usage

Run this to set up everything:
```bash
./install.sh
```

This sets up:
- Config file symlinks (fish, kitty)
- Autostart applications
- Custom keybinds
